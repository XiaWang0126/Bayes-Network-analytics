# Network-analytics

## Module overview

Networks are ubiquitous: job offerings reach us via inter-personal connections; what we see on the screen of our digital device is a function of the relationships we develop in the digital world; market valuations are ― largely ― the byproduct of social influence, which accumulates and spreads over relations.
