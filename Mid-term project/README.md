# Project Description

Students â€” working in groups â€” are supposed:

1. to get access to a network dataset to put at the center of the MTP. There are two options to do that: reusing data available in digital repositories, e.g., SNAP or Kaggle, or gathering data ex-novo (e.g., using a crawler ðŸ•¸ðŸ•·). Inter-personal, inter-organizational, technological, and physical networks are admitted types of networks for the MTP

2. to identify the relationhsip(s) included in the selected network dataset and to appreciate the economic, organizational, managerial, and/or social relevance of the relationship(s)

3. to use Python:

    i. to analyze and plot the degree distribution of the network
  
    ii. to plot the network
  
    iii. to produce descriptive statistics about relevant node-level properties (e.g., betweeness centrality)
  
    iv. to asssess how and to what extent the network shows a modular structure (e.g., a community or core-periphery structure)
  
    v. to assess the consequences of the modular structure for the individual nodes, the individual communities, and/or the functioning of the network. For example, one may want to correlate the network position of an individual (core Vs. periphery) with her attitudes, behavior, preferences.
